## Lab 005 - So many models

## API Gateway Models
So we have our POST from Lab003 which stores the complete object in DynamoDB. But maybe you don't like data polution in your table and want to make sure your clients send messages compliant to a message definition. This is possible with AWS API Gateway & Serverless by using models based on the json-schema.org definitions.
